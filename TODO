CPSRelation TODO
================

$Id: $

- add extension profile for setup
- avoid listing all the graph relations clicking on the graph in ZMI.
- Concurrency when accessing bdb graphs.
- Transactions management using external non-transactional storage (add/remove,
  see the CPSCore "before commit hook" mechanism).
- Be able to store graphs elsewhere than in relations tool (see CPSMailAccess
  use case).
- Change the API taking care of the fact that relations are not to be managed
  in RDF graphs as in historical IOBtreeGraph.
- Give a better query API looking at SPARQL/RDQL querying features.
